Homework 3, Password Generator

This is my incredible password generator!

In order to start the magic, you'll have to click the button.
Doing so will launch some prompts. 
It will ask you how long you want your random password to be. Your password has to be between 8 and 128 characters long. If you select anything higher or lower, or a non-number, it will show you an error and prompt you again until you provide a number between 8 & 128.

Then, it asks you if you want lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols. Depending on how you answer for each question, the generator will include the elements you've requested to be included.

Then the magic happens! It generates a password of the desired length using only and all of the options that were selected. The password is displayed in an alert, and then it is posted to the website.
